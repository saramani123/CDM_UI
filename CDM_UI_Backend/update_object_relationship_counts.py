Update Object Relationship Counts Script

This script updates the 'relationships' property on each Object node to match
the count of ADDITIONAL (non-default) RELATES_TO relationships only.

Default relationship = role = object name, frequency = 'Possible'. Those are
not counted. Only relationships added via the relationships modal (or CSV) are counted.

IMPORTANT: This script ONLY updates the 'relationships' property on Object nodes.
It does NOT create, delete, or modify any relationships.
